    <p>Steroids are divided into two main classes: androgenic, whose main function is to ‘masculinize’, which appears naturally in male bodies in order to regulate the development and maintenance of male characteristics; and anabolic, which provides muscle growth and strength boosts.
    </p>
    <div class="Sub">Legal usage</div>
    <p>Its legal use is to increase the muscle mass of livestock in order to increase their profitability. In the U.S., Trenbolone Acetate and other steroids are prescribed by veterinary doctors to farm owners if the vet is confident that the drug will be able to provide the growth effects to the cattle. According to marketwatch, the global Trenbolone Acetate market size is estimated to be worth 79 Million USD. In some countries, anabolic steroids are prescription-only medicines only given in critical conditions. 
    </p>
    <div class="Sub">Athletic usage</div>
    <p>Athletes and bodybuilders have been using trenbolone acetate as a physique and performance-enhancing drug since the 1950s. The use of anabolic steroids is prohibited in the olympics and most other sports competitions. Though, bodybuilding competitions like Mr Olympia and Mr Universe do not test their contestants and the majority of them have openly admitted to steroid usage. </p>
    <p>Federal charges from steroid usage are possible. In the U.S., possession of anabolic steroids in first and second offenses charge multiple thousand dollar fines and can send an athlete to jail for 1-2 years. Though, the DEA is not allowed to test athletes for steroid usage and therefore many athletes still use it. </p>
    <div class="Sub">Dangers and Side Effects</div>
    <p>Trenbolone side effects and dangers include:     </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Increase in cardiovascular strain in the left ventricle, causing increases in cholesterol and blood pressure 
      </li>
      <li>Natural testosterone suppression</li>
      <li>Facial and back acne</li>
      <li>Anxiety</li>
      <li>Depression</li>
      <li>Dry coughing</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mainArticle">

        <p>Different esters of Trenbolone (like Acetate and Enanthate) produce the same side effects. Though, they have varying length of esters and serum testosterone levels peak at different speeds, therefore affecting the timing of the side effects.
